# Powershell
Rob's Powershell Repo

This is just a collection of scripts I have written/collected over the years. Would not recommend using 
any of these scripts, they are very tailored to issues I have needed to resolve and most are not written
with Powershell best practices.

With that said, if you want to use anything here, feel free. It is licensed under the MIT license, see the License file.
